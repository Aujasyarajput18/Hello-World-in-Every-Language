# Fun Fact

Java was originally called "Oak" after a tree outside James Gosling's office window.
The name "Java" came from Java coffee, which the development team consumed in large quantities.
Java's "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy revolutionized software development by making programs portable across different operating systems.
