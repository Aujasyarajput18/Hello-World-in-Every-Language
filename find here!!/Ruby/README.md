# Hello World in Ruby 💎

This folder contains a simple Ruby program that prints **"Hello, World!"** to the console. Ruby is one of those languages that focuses more on developer happiness than strict rules — it’s clean, elegant, and fun to write.

## 🧠 About Ruby

Ruby was created by **Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto** back in the mid-90s. His main goal was to make programming feel natural and joyful. That’s why Ruby’s syntax reads almost like English.

It’s also the language behind **Ruby on Rails**, the web framework that powers sites like GitHub, Shopify, and Airbnb.

## 📄 The Code

Here’s the entire program — just one line:

```ruby
puts "Hello, World!"
```

Short, simple, and exactly what you’d expect from Ruby.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Check if Ruby is installed

Open your terminal and type:

```bash
ruby -v
```

If it shows a version number (like `ruby 3.2.2`), you’re good to go.

If not, install Ruby using one of the following commands:

* **macOS:**

  ```bash
  brew install ruby
  ```
* **Ubuntu/Linux:**

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install ruby-full
  ```
* **Windows:**
  Download and install from [rubyinstaller.org](https://rubyinstaller.org)

### 2. Run the script

Navigate to the Ruby folder in your terminal:

```bash
cd "Hello-World-in-Every-Language/find here!!/Ruby"
```

Then run:

```bash
ruby hello.rb
```

You should see:

```
Hello, World!
```

## 💡 Fun Fact

Ruby’s creator once said:

> “I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy.”

That’s the whole spirit behind this language — write less, smile more.
