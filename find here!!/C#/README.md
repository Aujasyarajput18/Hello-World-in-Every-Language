# 🧠 Fun Fact

C# was developed as Microsoft’s answer to Java, blending the power of C++ with the simplicity of Visual Basic.
Its name comes from the musical notation C♯, symbolizing an evolution or “sharp” step up from C.
Today, it powers everything from Unity game engines to enterprise web apps on .NET.
