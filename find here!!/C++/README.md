# 🧠 Fun Fact
C++ was originally called “C with Classes” — a direct extension of C that introduced object-oriented programming.
It’s still one of the most powerful and widely used languages for system software, game engines, and high-performance applications.
Even now, many of your favorite apps, browsers, and games rely on C++ under the hood.
