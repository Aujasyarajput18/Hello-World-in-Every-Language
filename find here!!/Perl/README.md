# üß† Fun Fact

Perl was originally designed for text processing and report generation (its name is a backronym for "Practical Extraction and Report Language"). It is famous for its powerful, built-in regular expression engine. Its philosophy is "There's more than one way to do it" (TMTOWTDI), making it a flexible "Swiss Army chainsaw" for programmers.
