# Brief History

PHP originally stood for "Personal Home Page" but was later renamed to "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".
It was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1995 as a simple set of Perl scripts to track visitors to his online resume.
PHP evolved from a simple templating language to a full-featured programming language that powers over 75% of websites on the internet.
Major versions include PHP 3 (1998), PHP 4 (2000), PHP 5 (2004), PHP 7 (2015), and PHP 8 (2020).
